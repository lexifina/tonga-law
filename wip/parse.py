"""Tonga: cached AGO Revised Edition PDFs (+ post-2020 amending Acts) -> corpus.json (gitlaw_common SCHEMA.md).

Reads only .cache/ (through fetch.get, which never refetches a cached URL). Deterministic.

Method, per act:
1. Parse each official Revised Edition (1988, 2016, 2020) into provisions (layout.py).
2. The 1988 edition is the oldest text online: it is the first version (first_law null), dated 31 December 1988, the day
   it states it was revised to. Its inline notes name the Acts in each provision; where a note names an Act that came
   into force after that day (the edition printed some later Acts), that provision is held back until the Act's
   commencement (FORK/BRIEF rule "text that appears before its law").
3. Between two editions, a provision whose words changed is dated by the Acts its endnote names that commenced
   between the two editions (commencement dates from the edition's own "Amendments after 1988" table). One such Act:
   the new words on its commencement day, credited to it. Several: the first Act's day gets a placeholder (the source
   gives no intermediate text), the last Act's day gets the new words. None: the change is the publisher's,
   "unexplained", on the edition's day.
4. Amending Acts after the 2020 edition are replayed from their official PDFs (amendments.py), each operation quoting
   the Act's own words.
